# Facebook Messenger bot that analyzes sentiment on Twitter

This is a Facebook messenger bot that accepts a query or phrase, pulls the last 1000 tweets containing that phrase, and performs a sentiment analysis on each tweet to come up with an overall "feeling" of the population for the phrase.

Tools used: tweepy, TextBlob

Initial template taken from a [tutorial](https://blog.hartleybrody.com/fb-messenger-bot/) that uses Flask to build a webhook for Facebook's Messenger Bot API. Huge thanks.
